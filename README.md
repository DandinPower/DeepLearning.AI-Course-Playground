# DeepLearning.AI-Course-Playground

This repository contains the Roadmap, Notes, and Playgrounds for the short course on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)

## Installation

1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Setup API Key
```bash
touch .env
# Add the following line to the .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
TAVILY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
